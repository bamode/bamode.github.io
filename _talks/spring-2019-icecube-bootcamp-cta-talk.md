I gave this talk at the Spring 2019 IceCube bootcamp in Madison, WI. IceCube is a well-known neutrino experiment located at the south pole, headquartered at the Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center (WIPAC). Though the center of WIPAC efforts is the administration of IceCube, the center also houses Universit of Wisconsin involvement in several major astroparticle physics experiments, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). In the interest of broadening the scientific knowledge of IceCube students, I was asked to give a talk introducing TeV gamma ray astrophysics, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), and CTA. The talk ends with an overview of UW involvement with the pSCT camera.
