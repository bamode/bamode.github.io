 I am a graduate student in Physics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison studying astroparticle physics as a member of the Cherenkov Telescope Array experiment ([CTA](https://www.cta-observatory.org)). I am interested in using high-energy gamma rays to study dark matter, fundamental physics, and transient astrophysical objects. Currently, most of my work is centered around development of the camera for the prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope ([pSCT](https://cta-psct.physics.ucla.edu)).This involves various aspects of electronic hardware development, scripting remote operation of laboratory equipment, and writing low-level data analysis software in order to characterize new camera electronics for the pSCT.

 On this website, you will find information on my current and past research experiences, professional history, outreach involvement, and other personal interests. Thanks for visiting!
